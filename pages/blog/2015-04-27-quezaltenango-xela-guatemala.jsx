We arrived in Quetzaltenango, or Xela (pronounced sha-la) as pretty much every
refers to it, quite late on a Sunday afternoon. Travelling in my usual manner, I
showed up without having pre-organised my enrolment at the school, or a place to
stay.

We arrived in Quetzaltenango, or Xela (pronounced sha-la) as pretty much every
refers to it, quite late on a Sunday afternoon. Travelling in my usual manner, I
showed up without having pre-organised my enrolment at the school, or a place to
stay.
</p>
<p>
Rachel and Sarah had both pre-enrolled and were staying in a home stay organised
through the school, Celas Maya, but being late on a Sunday I had my doubts about
whether I'd be able to enrol to start the next day, but it turned out that
wasn't a problem at all so we were all set to start the next day on most
intensive class schedule I've done yet, 5 hours one-on-one a day, 5 days a week.
</p>

<p>
After my schooling was sorted I set out to find a place to stay. I ended up
getting my own private room at a newly started hostel not too far from school,
in an old colonial style house that had a big open courtyard in the middle.
</p>

<p>
I got an much earlier start the next day then planned, with a very strong
earthquake hitting nearby at 5:30am that rumbled long enough for me to realise
what it was, get out of bed and go stand in the door frame, and still have it
keep shaking for another 15-20 seconds while I stood there in just my boxer
shorts in the cold as everyone else in the hostel also appeared at their doors
around the courtyard in various states of undress. An exciting start to Xela!
</p>

<p>
It was the middle of winter, and Xela is at a fair altitude, so mornings and
evenings were actually quite cold, and the middle of the day would heat up and
be almost hot, which meant I ended up dressing in layers and wearing zip off
pants to deal with the big swings in temperature.
</p>

<p>
I got assigned a teacher named Joel, a friendly younger guy who was into
photography, and would bring in photo books for us to look through and discuss
the buildings and places he'd taken photos of. It was actually pretty cool.
</p>

<p>
At the start of the week we discussed the stuff I wanted to cover and worked out
a basic plan for the tenses I wanted to work on and the areas he thought I
should include, and then each day the lessons would be quite varied. Some days
was entirely conversation, others I'd be working of a sheet of phrases and
changing their personas and tenses verbally on the fly, another day he even had
me listen to a song and try and work out the lyrics.
</p>

<p>
Rachel, Sarah and myself got permission to take our teachers with us to the
market at San Francisco one day in place of classes so we could have a look
around and ask questions.
</p>

<p>
We took a chicken bus there and then wandered around through the area where they sell
animals and livestock. There was all sort of animals, pigs and piglets, sheep,
cows, bunnies, cats, puppies, ducks, roosters and chickens and chicks. A lot of
them were super cute, but it was a bit sad to see how some of them are handled,
baskets full of chickens with a net tied over it to keep them in with there
heads poking out.
</p>

<p>
We looked around the clothing and fabric section and saw a load of beautiful
traditional Mayan fabrics in bright vibrant colours.
</p>

<p>
We visited a church that let us go up onto  the roof to see the view. In the
Central American way, there was no real safety or barriers; just us walking
around on top of the big rounded rooftop.
</p>

<p>
We went through the food and produce section and saw the open sacks of grains
and corn, often with big blankets covered in currently drying grains. Loads of
delicious looking fruit, and questionable looking cooked seafood just sitting out
in the sun.
</p>

<p>
I felt the more varied approach to learning at Celas Maya suited me way better
than any of the other schools I'd been to, and that my Spanish improved more here
than it did at any other point. It's easily the best school I've been to yet. By
the end of the week though, I was feeling completely burnt out. Not so much by
the challenge, but being an introvert and having to spend 5 hours a day having
somewhat forced feeling conversation.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, we went on an excursion with the school to some natural hot
springs called Fuentes Georginas set high up in the hills. It was a beautiful
site with lush green plants all around it, and the heat of the pools helped add
to the mist that sort of hung over the place.
</p>

<FlickrImageLegacy flickrID="17045793041" linkUrl="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/17045793041/in/set-72157651783002242" caption="Fuentes Georginas" />

<p>
There were three pools of water, each a little cooler than the one before it.
The hottest one I could barely cope with even just my knees in the water, the
middle one was still too hot to be comfortable, and the coolest one was much
better, but still too warm to stay in for long.
</p>

<p>
A lot of other afternoon I organised to take some private salsa lessons at a dance
studio with a great teacher named Nestor. While other lessons I'd taken had
focused entirely on actual dance steps, Nestor took the first lesson just to
work on actual stepping techniques, balance and weight shifting and gave me some
exercise drills to practice to try and develop smoother flow. It felt a lot more
productive than than just being told "loosen up."
</p>

<p>
We did cover actual dance steps too, but instead of just teaching a sequence
Nestor explained the ways to silently communicate to your partner what you're
about to do. A gentle push to the hip here, raising a hand across their body,
all sorts of subtle hints like that.
</p>

<p>
On the weekend we did two more excursions through the school, although Rachel,
Sarah and I were the only ones who signed up so they were basically private tours.
</p>

<FlickrImageLegacy flickrID="16870562269" linkUrl="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16870562269/in/set-72157651783002242" caption="Me above Laguna Chicabal crater" />

<p>
One morning we met up at with our guide at school at 6am, and then got a
colectivo over to the town at the bottom of the old volcano that contains
Chicabal Laguna. We hiked up the long road through the forest to the rim of the
crater were we had a lovely view of the Laguna.
</p>

<p>
We then went down a long flight to stair to get down to the edge of the Laguna
and hiked around it before heading back up a different route and then back down
the long road to town to get a colectivo back to Xela.
</p>

<p>
The other morning we were up at 4:15am to go and see Volcan Santiaguito, one of
the most active volcanoes in Guatemala, often erupting every half-hour or so. We
got a minibus to the start of the hike, then hiked for a few hours through
fields surrounded by thick green forests to the lookout to Santiaguito.
</p>

<p>
It erupted quite soon after we arrived with a thick plume of smoke, and then
after a slight delay there was a huge booming thunder as the sound of the
eruption reached us. It was really quite impressive to see and hear from so close.
</p>

<FlickrImageLegacy flickrID="16869375800" linkUrl="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/16869375800/in/set-72157651783002242" caption="It was rather cold and miserable up there" />

<p>
We waited for nearly an hour in the hope we'd get to see it go off again, but
alas, it lay dormant after that first eruption, and we were all far too cold to
want to hang around waiting much longer.
